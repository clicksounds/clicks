    "description": "Version 1: Initial release. I added the version info for updates in near future. The pack of my old, but gold laptop that i used to work and play on it in the past years, and i still kept it somehow so i made a laptop spacebar clickpack out of that. Pack will be updated and Version 1 is also avaliable in ZCB. I will extend and update this pack in this weekend or later, and also i made the sounds have stereo channels to avoid bugs.",
